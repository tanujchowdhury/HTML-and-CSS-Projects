# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
=======================
Here is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects
-----------
* [Lands Between Site](Basic_HTML_and_CSS/project/index.html)
* [Bay Area Tourneys Site](bootstrap4_project/bay_area_tourneys.html)

### Lands Between Site

This page is an example home page of a travel company for a fantasy world. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site

This page is an example home page of a Tournament planner that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components such as a navbar, jumbotron, forms, cards, and dropdowns.
